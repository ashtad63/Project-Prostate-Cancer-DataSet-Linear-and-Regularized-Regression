# Project: Prostate Cancer DataSet Linear and Regularized Regression

We are going to use Prostate Cancer data to gain some insights into what might be useful in predicting \
log level of PSA (prostate specific antigen) for men with prostate cancer. 

We will use basic linear regression and regularized linear regression (ridge and lasso).  Many models will \
be developed and evaluated.  Features will be removed from the dataset, one at a time, and models wii be \
evaluated (scored) to find the best set of features for linear regression. \

Ridge regression will be used on both the full dataset, as well as, the best model found with linear regression.  \
Lasso regression will be used on the full dataset. The best alphas will be found for the regularized regression \
models using cross-validation.

The model attributes will be captured and reported in tables and list for each of the models being evaluated.
